######### CASE STUDY PRESENTATION #############################################################
### Prediction of genetic value of sunflower cultivars for yield 
### based on the phenotypic results of a Multi-Environment Trial (MET)
# 6 sunflower genotypes -"NK Countri", "PR64H41", "Atomic", "Santiago", "Boogy", "Aurasol"- 
# grown in 5 environments near Toulouse (France) -"Odars", "Verfeil", "Villefranche", "Fourquevaux"- 
# and evaluated in a VERY UNBALANCED design.
# during 3 years -2003, 2005, 2007 -


######### PREPARATION OF THE WORKING INTERFACE IN R ######################################
### I. Set working directory
#On RStudio: tab 'Session'-> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory.
#Choose the directory containing the R script.

### II. Installation R packages needed for the analysis on RStudio:
#Click on the 'Packages' tab in the bottom-right window of R Studio interface->'Install Packages'
#Comment #1: R package installation requires a connection to internet
#Comment #2: Once packages have been installed, NO need to re-install them again 
# when you close and open again RStudio.

### III. Initialisation of the working space:clean workspace, clean memory 
# To erase all graphs
graphics.off()
# To erase objects from the working space - Clean up of the memory
rm(list = ls())
# garbage collector. To use to free memory
gc() 


## indicate here the folder where are located the data
## and subdirs where outputs will be stored
main_dir <- dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path) 
setwd(paste(main_dir, "./data3/", sep = ""))

# into account the Site X Year interaction.
# If it was the case: X_envXyear <- model.matrix( ~ sunflower$ENV * sunflower$YEAR)

#' We new need to compute the 'effects' of the environments *i.e.* the numerical values of the effect of the 
#' different years and the different sites. It exists 2 solutions to solve this linear systems

# Solution 1: ANOVA Constraint "sum to 0" 
# alpha Env1 + alpha Env2 + alpha Env3 + ... = 0.

#' The X matrix created with the function `model.matrix` contains (Env-1) columns: Balma column is not present, 
#' The function `model.matrix` order the Factor level by alphabetical order and remove the 1st level (here, `Balma` )

# 2003 Estimated mean = intercept = 1534.75 + 0 = 1534.75

# If Site X Year interaction is considered in the model then intercept = Estimated mean for Balma_2003.

## alternatively, one can compute this matrix using: --------------------------

# By default, model.matrix add an intercept. However, for random effect, there 
# are no intercept.  
# By default, Genotypes in alphabetical order in Z matrix

#' ## Calculation of the genetic values as BLUP from centered values of phenotypes 


#' We want to fit the following model for BLUP $y2 = mean(y) + Zu + E$.  
#' In this case, we do not account for the **fixed** environment effects.

#' Solving the system for random effects needs to take into account the `VarCov` matrix of the random effects (i.e. that will be later the pedigree matrix). 
#' In this first analysis, we do not have information about the relastionships between the genotypes. We will use the identity matrix. I = diag(6)

#' We will use $y2 = y - mean(y)$ as phenotypic values
#y2 <- (sunflower$YLD) - mean(sunflower$YLD) #Obs. Mean = 1502.333

# Solution of the linear model:
#uhatSimple <- solve(t(Z) %*% Z + 1*diag(6)) %*% t(Z) %*% y2
# 1*diag(6)=lambdaG with sigmaE/sigmaU arbitrarily set to 1
