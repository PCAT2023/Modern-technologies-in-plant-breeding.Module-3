# BioGeography
## Using envirotyping data to assess population stucture

Using data from `WorldClim` repository and combining with data of population stratification, we will explore the population structure of a wild legume around the Mediterannean Basin.

To get ready for the tutorials, please download the following software/R packages to your local machine

1. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
2. R packages: [adegenet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adegenet/), [ggplot2](), [mapplots](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapplots), [maptools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools), [rworldmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rworldmap), [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster), [rgdal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal), [RColorBrewer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer), [psych](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych), [corrplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot)

## The data for running the analyses can be found in the sub-directories.
The genotypes and additional data for climate variables are provided in the ../data/ directory. You will need to unzip the files for climatic variables.

You may download the repository as a zip file to your own machine and appropriate folder: Use **CODE / Download ZIP**. After extraction, all elements will be in place.  

Alternatively, you may download the data files, download or copy the scripts to your own machine and appropriate folder, and change the directory as needed to run the analysis.

This will allow us to raise the question about core collections: stratification-based or maximisation-based strategies ?
