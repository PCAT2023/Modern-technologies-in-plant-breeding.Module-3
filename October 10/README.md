## Accounting for heterogeneous variances among environments: a classical question.
A very general case: the variation of the trait is different depending on the diffrent environments.

## Alternative views on how to 'understand' the structure of the GxE matrix
Using the Singular matrix Decomposition, how to 'explore' the relationships between a genotype and the Environments. This provide a *different* and **complementaty** view to the Joint-Regression analysis.
